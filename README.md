## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  

I have been working as a Data Scientist for Tiendanube/Nuvemshop, a B2B, SaaS company, for almost two years. My journey to Data Science began when I started my Ph.D. in psycho and neurolinguistics. In that process I realized that what I loved most was designing and implementing experiments, and modeling data to analyze the results.  

At my current job I handle big amounts of data, implement supervised and unsupervised ML models, report insights to key stakeholders, and lead a team of four data scientists.

### Projects
I have worked on or supervised projects about:
 - Topic modelling and tagging of customer support conversations
 - Customer clustering using Amplitude events and product configurations
 - Chatbot for customer support
 - Data Science toolkit for our team
 - Quality lead predictor: predict if a trial will pay after trial period
 - Quality partner predictor: predict if a commercial partner will bring a new client
 - Churn analysis: failed predictor project =(
 - Perfect client modelling to find out what our best clients do and how we can make recommendations based on those practices to other clients
 - Market basket analysis for apps marketplace
 - Customer journey visualization using Amplitude events and sankey diagrams
 - A/B tests of user onboarding
 - A/B tests of e-commerce checkout page
