### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Data Scientist from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  

I have been working as a Data Scientist for Tiendanube/Nuvemshop, a B2B, SaaS company, for almost two years. My journey to Data Science began when I started my Ph.D. in psycho and neurolinguistics. In that process I realized that what I loved most was designing and implementing experiments, and modeling data to analyze the results.  

At my current job I handle big amounts of data, implement supervised and unsupervised ML models, report insights to key stakeholders, and lead a team of four data scientists.
